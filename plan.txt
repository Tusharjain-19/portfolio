Locked. 🔒
You’ve made a bold but smart combo:

Home: Big typography first

Projects: Animated overlay (modal-style)

This is GEN-Z expressive, but we’ll keep it recruiter-safe by doing it cleanly and fast.

Now I’m going to give you the exact homepage design + animation timeline, frame by frame. No guessing, no fake stuff.

🏠 HOMEPAGE — FINAL DESIGN (FRAME BY FRAME)
FRAME 0 — Page Load (0–300ms)

Goal: Instant presence, no lag.

White or dark background (based on system theme)

Custom cursor loads immediately (small dot)

No animation yet → fast paint

FRAME 1 — HERO TYPOGRAPHY (300ms–1.5s)
What user sees:

Big, bold text. Center-left aligned.

Text (example, we’ll refine later):

I build real products
that actually ship.


Under it (smaller, animated in):

Frontend • Hardware • MVPs

Animation:

Text reveals line-by-line

Slight Y-translate + opacity

Cursor becomes magnetic over keywords

Why this works:

Recruiters instantly understand you

No visual overload at start

FRAME 2 — SUBTEXT + CTA (1.5s–2.5s)

Below hero text:

Selected work ↓


Arrow gently oscillates

Cursor changes to “SCROLL” on hover

FRAME 3 — SCROLL START (Projects Tease)

As user scrolls:

Hero text scales down slightly

Background shifts color subtly

First project title fades in big

Example:

VITAL HEALTH TECH


Behind it:

Faint animated ECG line

Cursor becomes pulse dot

🧩 PROJECT OVERLAY SYSTEM (YOUR 2️⃣ B CHOICE)
How it works

Clicking a project does NOT change URL immediately

Instead:

Background freezes

Project expands from card → full-screen overlay

Body scroll locked

URL updates to /work/vital-health-tech (optional but recommended)

This keeps:

GEN-Z feel

SEO

Back button support

OVERLAY OPEN ANIMATION (KEY DETAIL)

Sequence (≈600ms):

Project card scales to full screen

Border radius animates to 0

Background dims

Content fades + slides in

Cursor changes to:

CLOSE ✕

🧠 INSIDE PROJECT OVERLAY (CASE STUDY FLOW)

Each overlay uses the real structure you demanded:

SECTION 1 — HOW I GOT THIS IDEA

Short paragraph

Handwritten-style underline animation

SECTION 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT

Bold, uncomfortable truth

Red accent line animates across text

SECTION 3 — SOLUTION

Diagram or animated cards

Sensors / system blocks animate in

SECTION 4 — DEMO

Video / GIF

Hover = play

Tap on mobile

SECTION 5 — LEARNINGS (IMPORTANT)

This is your killer differentiator.

Example:

What I learned:
• MVP beats perfect planning
• Hardware fails in unexpected ways
• Simple systems scale better


No fake research. Pure honesty.

🖱️ CURSOR SYSTEM (MUST-HAVE ✔)
Cursor states:

Default → dot

Hover text → magnetic circle

Project → label (“OPEN”)

Overlay → “CLOSE”

Mobile:

Cursor disabled

Tap ripples instead

🎥 SOUND + VIDEO (CONTROLLED)

Sound off by default

Small toggle icon

Sounds only on:

Overlay open

Hover (soft click)

No autoplay. Browser-safe.

⚡ PERFORMANCE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Rule	Status
Next/Image only	✅
Videos lazy-loaded	✅
No heavy 3D on load	✅
Overlay content loaded on click	✅
Mobile optimized	✅

This will load fast, even with animations.

🔥 WHY THIS COMBO IS PERFECT FOR YOU

Big typography = clarity

Overlay projects = personality

Learnings section = honesty

MVP-first = your real mindset

This is not fake.
This is not over-designed.
This is you, but amplified.

NEXT STEP (DO THIS NOW)

I now need raw material from you, nothing fancy.

Reply with:
1️⃣ Which project to build first (Vital / BookMySlot / etc.)
2️⃣ What proof you have for it (photos / video / links)

Once you answer, I’ll:

Design the exact project overlay layout

Write real copy using your words

Then give you Next.js MVP code structure

We’re officially building now 🚀

now make a plan for this website that include all things
include basic to basic things and advance everithing

Perfect. Now I’ll give you a complete end-to-end plan for this portfolio website.
This is not “design ideas”. This is a build plan you can actually execute, from zero → MVP → insane gen-z polish.

No fake stories. No research fluff. Real builder flow.

🚀 PORTFOLIO WEBSITE MASTER PLAN (NEXT.JS)
🎯 CORE GOALS (LOCKED)
Goal	How we achieve it
Get internship callbacks	Clear typography + real case studies
Impress senior engineers	Architecture + learnings sections
Gen-Z wow factor	Cursor, overlays, motion, scroll
Fast load	MVP-first, lazy everything
Mobile friendly	Separate motion rules
🧠 PHASE 0 — FOUNDATION (Before Code)
0.1 Define truth (VERY IMPORTANT)

For each project, you must have:

What problem you actually saw

What you actually built

What broke

What you learned

❌ No fake users
❌ No fake numbers
✅ Honest learning > perfection

0.2 Content checklist (from YOU)

You must prepare:

Project titles

Short descriptions (2–3 lines)

Any photos / videos / links you already have

What you did not build (constraints)

This avoids “portfolio lies”.

🧱 PHASE 1 — TECH STACK (BASIC → ADVANCED)
1.1 Core Stack (MVP)
Tool	Purpose
Next.js (App Router)	Routing, SEO
TypeScript	Safety
Tailwind CSS	Speed
next/image	Performance

This alone gives you a working site.

1.2 Motion Stack (Added gradually)
Tool	Why
GSAP	Cursor, scroll, complex timelines
Framer Motion	Page & overlay transitions
Lenis	Smooth scrolling
CSS animations	Cheap micro-interactions

⚠️ Rule: No animation before MVP works

1.3 Optional Advanced Stack (Later)
Tool	Use
Spline	Lightweight 3D
Zustand	Global UI state
MDX	Case studies
Web Audio API	Hover / transition sound
🧩 PHASE 2 — SITE STRUCTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Routes
/
└── /work
    └── /[slug]
/about
/contact


But remember:
👉 Projects open as animated overlays, not classic navigation.

Component Tree
Layout
 ├─ CustomCursor
 ├─ PageTransition
 ├─ Navbar
 ├─ SoundToggle
 └─ Footer

🏠 PHASE 3 — HOMEPAGE (BIG TYPOGRAPHY FIRST)
3.1 Hero Section (Basic)

Big text

One clear message

Minimal animation

Example structure:

<h1>Big idea</h1>
<p>Short supporting line</p>

3.2 Hero Animation (Advanced)

Line-by-line reveal

Subtle scale on scroll

Magnetic cursor on keywords

3.3 Scroll Hint

“Selected Work ↓”

Micro animation

Cursor text change

🧩 PHASE 4 — PROJECTS SECTION (CORE FEATURE)
4.1 Project Cards (Basic)

Each project card:

Title

One-line idea

Background image or color

4.2 Hover State (Advanced)

Cursor changes to “OPEN”

Image parallax

Card slightly lifts

4.3 Click → Overlay (Your choice B)

On click:

Card expands

Page freezes

Overlay opens

This feels premium and gen-z.

📂 PHASE 5 — PROJECT OVERLAY (CASE STUDY)

Each project overlay has fixed structure.

Section order (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ How I got this idea

Personal

Short

Honest

2️⃣ Problem statement

Real pain

No buzzwords

3️⃣ Solution

Architecture

Tools

Why these choices

4️⃣ Demo

Video / GIF / images

Hover to play

Tap on mobile

5️⃣ Learnings (CRITICAL)

This is what recruiters love.

Example:

MVP > research

Hardware fails differently than software

Simpler systems are easier to debug

6️⃣ Proof

GitHub

Live links

APK

Photos

🧠 PHASE 6 — LEARNINGS SYSTEM (UNIQUE PART)

You will have two levels of learning:

6.1 Per-project learnings

Shown inside each overlay.

6.2 Global learnings (About page)

Example:

Learned to ship before polishing

Learned debugging > theory

Learned that constraints create better products

This makes you look mature, not flashy.

🖱️ PHASE 7 — CURSOR SYSTEM (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Cursor states
State	Behavior
Default	Small dot
Hover link	Circle + text
Project	“OPEN”
Overlay	“CLOSE”

Mobile:

Cursor disabled

Ripple / tap feedback instead

🎞️ PHASE 8 — PAGE & OVERLAY TRANSITIONS
Page transitions

Fade + slide

No hard cuts

Overlay transitions

Scale + opacity

Border radius morph

Sound:

Off by default

Optional toggle

🎨 PHASE 9 — THEMING (LIGHT + DARK)
Theme rules

Auto detect system

Manual toggle

Animated transition (200ms)

Color style:

Playful

Not neon overload

High contrast text

📱 PHASE 10 — MOBILE STRATEGY
Mobile rules

No cursor

Reduced animation

Swipe instead of horizontal scroll

Videos tap-to-play

Mobile ≠ desktop shrink.

⚡ PHASE 11 — PERFORMANCE (STRICT RULES)
Rule	Why
Lazy load overlays	Faster home
Lazy load videos	Bandwidth
No heavy 3D on load	FPS
Split motion logic	Clean code
🚧 PHASE 12 — MVP BUILD ORDER (THIS IS KEY)
Step 1 (Day 1–2)

Static Next.js site

Typography

Project list

Step 2 (Day 3–4)

Project overlay

One full case study (Vital Health Tech)

Step 3 (Day 5–6)

Cursor system

Hover effects

Step 4 (Day 7)

Scroll animations

Page transitions

Step 5 (After launch)

Sound

3D

Extra polish

🚨 MVP goes live before fancy stuff.

🧠 WHY THIS PLAN FITS YOU

Matches your MVP-first mindset

Shows real learning

Avoids fake UX research

Lets you ship fast, then upgrade

This is not a “portfolio”.
This is a proof of thinking + execution.



We build. No more talking. 💥
